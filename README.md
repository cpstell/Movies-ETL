# Movies-ETL

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Then we refactor the code we created in this module to create one function that takes in the three filesâ€”Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data. Finally, the ETL process is performed by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
